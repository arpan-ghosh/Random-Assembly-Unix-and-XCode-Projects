In this particular program, non-native Apple keyboards that have the ability to use LED can be powered, unlike the default state where Apple does not automatically detect LED enabled keys in most keyboards.

For this file, which is originally created by Apple, I edit the amount of passesfor the particular keyboard: http://www.coolermaster.com/peripheral/keyboards/devastator/. Instead of waiting up to three minutes to detect all 256 combination of passes, we can do a simple hack to have it stop within 10 seconds at 5 passes.
